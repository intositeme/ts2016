#### ScrollReveal.js & AniJS

**[ScrollReveal.js](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal.js)** is a set of tools that triggers a specific animation when the user scrolls the element into view. 
Live Sample on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/intosite/pen/jWKpEv).

**[AniJS](https://anijs.github.io/)** was created to help make it easier to apply effects with minimal knowledge of JavaScript.
Live Sample on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/intosite/pen/dGKjdW?editors=1010).
